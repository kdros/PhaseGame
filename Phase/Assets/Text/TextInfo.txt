We're entering a dark cave, but worry not. The plasma's glow enables Matty to see inside such caves.
BegLev3_Trigger3
Oh! A Swinging Mace is up ahead. Don't let it strike you!
BegLev3_Trigger4
Yikes, Spikes! Jump right past them by pressing Space and the right arrow key.
BegLev3_Trigger5
Aha, a Checkpoint! It saves your progress till now. Go ahead and touch it.
BegLev3_Trigger6
Holy Smokes! A flame pillar! Thankfully, in his plasma state, Matty is immune to fire!
BegLev3_Trigger7
Watch out for those deadly icicles! Dart past them!
BegLev3_Trigger8
Oh boy, a flaming lava pit! What next? Fire breathing dragons? Never mind. Matty is immune to fire in his plasma state. Jump right in and see what happens. 
BegLev3_Trigger9
He seems to enjoy it! He's picking up the heat from the lava and is emitting embers. His color is changing as well! He's red hot now! 
BegLev3_Trigger10
What's this? An Ice-covered floor? Our hero scoffs at it and marches past!
BegLev3_Trigger11
That's the end. All's well that ends well.
BegLev3_Trigger12
You know you've crossed a Checkpoint when it shows a green flag instead of a red one. If you die at any point from here onward, you will respawn here.  
BegLev3_Trigger13
Welcome to the Plasma state tutorial level. In this level, we'll learn to use Matty's plasma state to get past various traps. 
BegLev3_Trigger14
Ooh, some fancy trap sequences ahead. Use what you've learnt from this level, avoid them and dash to the finish!
BegLev3_Trigger15
That seems to have done the trick!
