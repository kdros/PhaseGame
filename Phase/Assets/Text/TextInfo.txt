Let's begin your training! Phase 1 -THE SOLID STATE. Change into solid state now by pressing 's'.
BegLev1_Trigger1
Spikes up ahead! Jump over them using SPACE and the RIGHT ARROW keys.
BegLev1_Trigger2
Nice job! Now you're going to want to avoid those swinging maces.
BegLev1_Trigger3
Be careful - pitfall ahead! Make sure to pick up some speed and jump across.
BegLev1_Trigger4
Whew that was close! Now watch out for the flames - Solid Matty will combust!
BegLev1_Trigger5
Awesome jumping! Careful of the swinging mace!
BegLev1_Trigger6
Check out that wind tunnel! Unfortunately, Matty is too heavy to float, so just keep going!
BegLev1_Trigger7
Congrats! You have reached your first checkpoint. If you die, you will now re-start here!
BegLev1_Trigger8
Up ahead is some ice - use the LEFT ARROW key to move across it and see him slide past those deadly icicles!
BegLev1_Trigger9
KEEP MOVING!
BegLev1_Trigger10
Great job! There's a grate up ahead, but no worries - just keep going!
BegLev1_Trigger11
Ahh watch out for that lava. Jump across!
BegLev1_Trigger12
Slide across the ice and avoid those deadly spikes!
BegLev1_Trigger13
Move quickly and watch out for the icicles!
BegLev1_Trigger14
Now risk using the ice to get past the maces or jump over it?! You decide!
BegLev1_Trigger15
Congratulations! Phase 1 of your training is complete!
BegLev3_Trigger1
There's a pitfall up ahead. Change into plasma state now by pressing 'F' and jump across it by pressing Space and the right arrow key.
BegLev3_Trigger2
We're entering a dark cave, but worry not. The plasma's glow enables Matty to see inside such caves.
BegLev3_Trigger3
Oh! A Swinging Mace is up ahead. Don't let it strike you!
BegLev3_Trigger4
Yikes, Spikes! Jump right past them by pressing Space and the right arrow key.
BegLev3_Trigger5
Aha, a Checkpoint! It saves your progress till now. Go ahead and touch it.
BegLev3_Trigger6
Holy Smokes! A flame pillar! Thankfully, in his plasma state, Matty is immune to fire!
BegLev3_Trigger7
Watch out for those deadly icicles! Dart past them!
BegLev3_Trigger8
Oh boy, a flaming lava pit! What next? Fire breathing dragons? Never mind. Matty is immune to fire in his plasma state. Jump right in and see what happens. 
BegLev3_Trigger9
He seems to enjoy it! He's picking up the heat from the lava and is emitting embers. His color is changing as well! He's red hot now! 
BegLev3_Trigger10
What's this? An Ice-covered floor? Our hero scoffs at it and marches past!
BegLev3_Trigger11
That's the end. All's well that ends well.
BegLev3_Trigger12
You know you've crossed a Checkpoint when it shows a green flag instead of a red one. If you die at any point from here onward, you will respawn here.  
BegLev3_Trigger13
Welcome to the Plasma state tutorial level. In this level, we'll learn to use Matty's plasma state to get past various traps. 
BegLev3_Trigger14
Ooh, some fancy trap sequences ahead. Use what you've learnt from this level, avoid them and dash to the finish!
BegLev3_Trigger15
That seems to have done the trick!
