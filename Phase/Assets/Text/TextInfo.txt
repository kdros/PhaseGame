BegLev1_Trigger0
Let's begin your training! Phase 1 -THE SOLID STATE. Change into solid state now by pressing 's'.
BegLev1_Trigger1
Spikes up ahead! Jump over them using SPACE and the RIGHT ARROW keys.
BegLev1_Trigger2
Nice job! Now you're going to want to avoid those swinging maces.
BegLev1_Trigger3
Be careful - pitfall ahead! Make sure to pick up some speed and jump across.
BegLev1_Trigger4
Whew that was close! Now watch out for the flames - Solid Matty will combust!
BegLev1_Trigger5
Awesome jumping! Careful of the swinging mace!
BegLev1_Trigger6
Check out that wind tunnel! Unfortunately, Matty is too heavy to float, so just keep going!
BegLev1_Trigger7
Congrats! You have reached your first checkpoint. If you die, you will now re-start here!
BegLev1_Trigger8
Up ahead is some ice - use the LEFT ARROW key to move across it and see him slide past those deadly icicles!
BegLev1_Trigger9
KEEP MOVING!
BegLev1_Trigger10
Great job! There's a grate up ahead, but no worries - just keep going!
BegLev1_Trigger11
Ahh watch out for that lava. Jump across!
BegLev1_Trigger12
Slide across the ice and avoid those deadly spikes!
BegLev1_Trigger13
Move quickly and watch out for the icicles!
BegLev1_Trigger14
Now risk using the ice to get past the maces or jump over it?! You decide!
BegLev1_Trigger15
Congratulations! Phase 1 of your training is complete!
BegLev3_Trigger1
There's a pitfall up ahead. Change into plasma state now by pressing 'F' and jump across it by pressing Space and the right arrow key.
BegLev3_Trigger2
We're entering a dark cave, but worry not. The plasma's glow enables Matty to see inside such caves.
BegLev3_Trigger3
Oh! A Swinging Mace is up ahead. Don't let it strike you!
BegLev3_Trigger4
Yikes, Spikes! Jump right past them by pressing Space and the right arrow key.
BegLev3_Trigger5
Aha, a Checkpoint! It saves your progress till now. Go ahead and touch it.
BegLev3_Trigger6
Holy Smokes! A flame pillar! Thankfully, in his plasma state, Matty is immune to fire!
BegLev3_Trigger7
Watch out for those deadly icicles! Dart past them!
BegLev3_Trigger8
Oh boy, a flaming lava pit! What next? Fire breathing dragons? Never mind. Matty is immune to fire in his plasma state. Jump right in and see what happens. 
BegLev3_Trigger9
He seems to enjoy it! He's picking up the heat from the lava and is emitting embers. His color is changing as well! He's red hot now! 
BegLev3_Trigger10
What's this? An Ice-covered floor? Our hero scoffs at it and marches past!
BegLev3_Trigger11
That's the end. All's well that ends well.
BegLev3_Trigger12
You know you've crossed a Checkpoint when it shows a green flag instead of a red one. If you die at any point from here onward, you will respawn here.  
BegLev3_Trigger13
Welcome to the Plasma state tutorial level. In this level, we'll learn to use Matty's plasma state to get past various traps. 
BegLev3_Trigger14
Ooh, some fancy trap sequences ahead. Use what you've learnt from this level, avoid them and dash to the finish!
BegLev3_Trigger15
That seems to have done the trick!
BegLev4_MessageWelcome
Welcome to the Gas state tutorial level. In this level, we'll learn the features of Matty's plasma state and how to use them to get past various traps. Switch to the gas state by pressing 'D'.
BegLev4_MessageSpikes
There are spikes ahead, and Gas Matty cannot jump! Hmm.. Will the gust of wind be beneficial?
BegLev4_MessageAfterSpikes
Oh yeah, that helped! These Wind Tunnels should turn out to be extremely useful to Gas Matty. 
BegLev4_MessageMace
A swinging mace up ahead. But can it harm such an amorphous form as Gas Matty's?
BegLev4_MessageWindTunnel
We need to move up to the platform above, and conveniently there's another Wind Tunnel. Step into it.
BegLev4_MessageIcicles
Icicles are beneficial to Gas Matty since they allow him to condense and create water droplets, which you can use to your advantage.
BegLev4_MessageIcyFloor
Icy Floors and Ceilings, like Icicles allow you to use condensation as a tool to get past certain traps.
BegLev4_MessageCheckpoint
Checkpoint! Save your progress by touching it. A visible green flag indicates that a checkpoint has been cleared.
BegLev4_MessageFlamePillar
Watch out for that Flame Pillar! It can kill Matty by dissipating him.
BegLev4_MessageLavaPit
Gas Matty hates flames. Lava Pit can kill him, just like Flame Pillars. Fortunately, there's a Wind Tunnel to help you get past. But you won't find one everytime.
BegLev4_MessagePitfall
Avoid pitfalls at all costs! Matty will sink to an unrecoverable abyss otherwise. 
BegLev4_MessageBoulders
Boulders right where we're gonna land! Worry not, since Gas Matty's amorphous form makes him invulnerable to these.
BegLev4_MessageFlamePillarTrap
Holy smokes, we're being swept right towards a flame pillar! Avoid it by swerving to the side!
BegLev4_MessageEnd
That's the end of the Gas state tutorial. Remember to use your learnings about Matty's interactions with the various traps here to solve more difficult puzzles in other levels.
BegLev2_Boulders
QUICK, PRESS 'A' TO CHANGE BACK TO LIQUID and avoid a collision with those boulders!
BegLev2_Checkpoint
Ah, a Checkpoint! It saves your progress in the level and respawns you here once you die from this point forth. A visible green flag indicates that you cleared it.
BegLev2_FlamePillar
Liquid Matty hates flames, and with good reason - they can vaporize him. Watch out for that flame pillar!
BegLev2_Grate
What's this? A Lava Pit ahead guarded by long spikes? It seems it isn't possible to jump over it. Would these grates be useful? Let's find out. Step onto it and press 'A' to change into Liquid Matty.
BegLev2_Icicle
Icicles and Icy Floors can freeze Liquid Matty to death. Do not touch them at any cost!
BegLev2_IcyPitfall
A long pitfall up ahead and Liquid Matty can't jump! Besides, the Icy Floor would kill him. Could he transition to Solid state to make use of this? 
BegLev2_Mace
Hah, a mace can't stop Liquid Matty! Onward bound!
BegLev2_PastBoulders
That's the way to go! So, Matty really needs to use his different forms in unison to get past traps. Drop down to the platform below to complete your training.
BegLev2_Spikes
Spikes can't harm Matty in his liquid form. In fact, this is the only form that is unharmed by spikes!
BegLev2_Welcome
Welcome to the Liquid State tutorial level. Here we will learn how the various traps affect Liquid Matty and therefore, how to use this state to successfully clear traps in advanced levels.  
IntLev3_IceJump
There is a platform far away. I will need to pick up enough speed for the jump!
IntLev3_LongJump
Almost there! I can see the exit in the distance. There are some platforms ahead of me, but they are too far. If only there is a way to make my body lighter during my jumps!"
